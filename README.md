## **Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project**

#### 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing sentiments in tweets using a machine learning approach. We leverage a **Logistic Regression** model to classify tweets as positive or negative, achieving strong performance metrics on a massive dataset of **1.6 million tweets**.  

#### 📂 **Dataset**  
The dataset used in this project is the **Sentiment140 dataset**, which contains 1.6 million labeled tweets. You can download the dataset from Kaggle using the link below:

#### ⚙️ **Steps in the Project**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning and tokenizing raw text data.  
   - Feature extraction using word representations (e.g., bag of words or TF-IDF).  

2. **Model Development**  
   - Training a Logistic Regression model on the processed data.  

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Achieved **80% accuracy on training/validation data**.  
   - Demonstrated **70% accuracy on unseen test data**, indicating good generalizability.  

#### 🚀 **Technologies Used**  
- Python 🐍  
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK  

#### 📝 **How to Run the Project**  
1. Download the dataset from the [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140).  
2. Clone this repository and place the dataset file in the `data` folder.  
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
